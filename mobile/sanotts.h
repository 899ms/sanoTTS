/* sanotts.h -- a small, binding-friendly C API over the sanoTTS nano runtime.
 *
 * snt_nano.h is an embedded interface: the caller owns an arena, hands over
 * two weight blobs, supplies a noise seed, and receives PCM through a
 * streaming callback. That is exactly right on a microcontroller and exactly
 * wrong to bind from Swift, Kotlin or Dart.
 *
 * This layer keeps the same runtime and adds nothing to the maths. It owns
 * the arena and the weights, buffers the whole waveform, and exposes an
 * opaque handle plus plain scalars -- the shape that Dart FFI, JNI and a
 * Swift module map all consume without glue code.
 *
 *   sanotts *tts = sanotts_open("front_q8.bin", "model_q8.bin");
 *   float *pcm; int n;
 *   sanotts_speak(tts, ids, n_ids, &pcm, &n);
 *   ... play n samples at sanotts_sample_rate(tts) ...
 *   sanotts_free_pcm(pcm);
 *   sanotts_close(tts);
 *
 * Threading: a handle is NOT thread-safe; give each thread its own, or
 * serialise. Opening twice costs another arena but the weight blobs are
 * per-handle too, so prefer one handle reused.
 *
 * Input is phoneme ids, not text. This library does no G2P -- see
 * mobile/README.md for why, and what to do about it.
